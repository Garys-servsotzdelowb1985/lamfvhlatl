Dude, just finished Ad Vitam and I'm like... whoa. Didn't think I'd vibe with it this much, you know? It starts off kinda meh, but then bam, hits you with all these existential feels. Like what's the point of immortality if everyone’s still a mess, right?

I mean, I've been thinking... If we can live forever, why’s everyone still so damn depressed? It's like, hey, you finally downloaded the movie, congratulations, now keep wondering why you did it. Seriously, gotta say, it digs deep into what it means to be alive and all that jazz. The whole eternal life dilemma... feels like a never-ending Black Friday sale of emotions or something.

> The main dude, Darius, is such a mood tho. He's like, Hey, lemme rebel against the never-dying crowd. Can you imagine living forever and still having to deal with the same old drama? At that point, I'd be like, Nah, I'm good, thanks! Besides, the tech they use to keep people young... lowkey creepy, but kinda cool. Makes you wonder if we’re heading there IRL.

Oh, and get this, I almost didn’t watch the movie till the end ‘cause my Wi-Fi’s being a pain. But man, glad I stuck it out. It's not every day you watch a show that messes with your head in a good way. And those visuals, bro, kinda make you wanna jump into the future but also avoid it, LOL.

Gotta hit the hay now, been a long day, but dude, hit me up with whatever you think if you end up watching it. Just... make sure your Wi-Fi’s solid, haha. Peace!
